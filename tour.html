                At Microsourcing, like the other companies, they explained how they started and gave us a tour of their office. They also showed us how to improve our LinkedIn profiles, and their employees were very interactive throughout the visit.</p>

                    We went to Tagaytay and visited the Palace in the Sky, but unfortunately, the weather wasn’t good. After that, we went to Sky Ranch where I experienced the Super Viking (the longest five minutes of my life) but we still enjoyed the rides a lot.

                    <p>We had an overnight stay in Baguio where we visited PMA, Bell Church, the Strawberry Farm, and Mines View.
